#### Automatic PET/CT staging methods for Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)
<p class="info">Visiting Scholar under Dr. Drew Torigian (05/2016 - 05/2020)<br>
University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA</p>
During medical school and residency, I have been involved in studying PET/CT staging methods for Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) to implement an automatic anatomy recognition model. Both independently and under the supervision of Dr. Torigian, a radiologist at University of Pennsylvania, I reviewed almost 100 PET/CT scans to identify lymphoma on patients with DLBCL. I learned about objectifying various markers such as size, location, and nodal involvement for staging cancer. As I became more familiar with PET/CT modalities, I was asked to be a part of a second project identifying neck lymph node zones. Both projects aim to decrease the discrepancy of film interpretations among radiologists by utilizing machine-learning techniques to recognize standard patterns in physical anatomy for diagnoses. I am currently working on additional data analysis for re-vision of manuscript, on which I will be the first author.

#### Mortality Rates in Breast and Lung Cancer Patients Admitted for Febrile Neutropenia
<p class="info">Researcher under Dr. Jain Maneesh (01/2016 - 05/2017)<br>
Drexel University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA</p>
As part of the monthly Hematology/Oncology interest group meeting and journal club, I participated in a research study that examined mortality rates of various types of cancer patients with febrile neutropenia. My involvement culminated in an abstract submission titled, “Higher Mortality Rates in Breast and Lung Cancer Patients Admitted for Febrile Neutropenia: An Analysis of Outcomes Based on Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2006-2013” for a poster presentation. This poster was presented at Discovery Day 2016, a school-wide presentation with attendings, residents, and other students in attendance.

#### Thymic Epithelial Cells Research
<p class="info">Postbaccalaureate Cancer Researcher under Dr. Richard Hodes (08/2012 - 06/2015)<br>
National Cancer Institute/NIH, Bethesda, MD</p>
I was a post-baccalaureate cancer research training award recipient at NIH in National Cancer Institute/Experimental Immunology Branch. I worked in Dr. Richard Hodes’ lab with seven other researchers studying thymic epithelial cells. I worked both in teams and independently to design a research question, set up mouse models to test the hypothesis, executed the experiments, and wrote manuscripts. The high level of my engagement led to co-authorships in three top-tier journal articles and presentations at the American Association for Immunologist conference in 2014 and 2015. In addition, during Post-bac Poster Day, I was awarded the Post-bac Poster Award for Outstanding Poster Presentation.
