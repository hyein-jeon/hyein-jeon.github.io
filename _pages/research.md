#### Oncotype in innercity hospital
<p class="info">Lead investigator under Dr. Mohammed Jaloudi (08/2020 - Present)<br>
Rutgers University NJMS, Newark, NJ</p>
We are conducting a retrospective chart review of oncotype results with patient’s actual
immunohistochemical results to assess utility of oncotype in inner-city under-resourced and
uninsured population. We are also assessing use of oncotype to assess for quality assurance measures for following standard of care in innter-city hospital.

#### DNR/DNI and end-of-life discussion during peak COVID-19 pandemic
<p class="info">Lead investigator under Dr. Eric Chyn (08/2020 - Present)<br>
Rutgers University NJMS, Newark, NJ</p>
During a COVID-19 pandemic, it has been particularly critical to ensure that life sustaining treatment
including intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are aligned with patient&#39;s values and
goals to avoid unnecessary invasive treatment in seriously ill or frail patients, reduce patient and loved
ones’ suffering, and ensure that patient’s final wishes are honored at the end of life. This is a
retrospective chart review of patients with DNR status to investigate whether COVID-19 patients with
DNR order differed as compared to non-COVID-19 patients with DNR order in terms of
demographics, pre-admission characteristics as well as palliative care interventions during
hospitalization. Currently, we are preparing a manuscript for submission.

#### COVID-19 Plasma project
<p class="info">Co-investigator under Dr. Marc Klapholtz (07/2020-Present)<br>
Rutgers University NJMS, Newark, NJ</p>
During the pandemic, convalescent plasma was approved for compassionate use against
SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have studied the safety and efficacy of administering plasma via
retrospective chart review. Currently, we are preparing for manuscript of 30-day outcome
with higher matched controls.

#### Automatic PET/CT staging methods for Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)
<p class="info">Visiting Scholar under Dr. Drew Torigian (05/2016 - 05/2020)<br>
University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA</p>
During medical school and residency, I have been involved in studying PET/CT staging methods for Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) to implement an automatic anatomy recognition model. Both independently and under the supervision of Dr. Torigian, a radiologist at University of Pennsylvania, I reviewed almost 100 PET/CT scans to identify lymphoma on patients with DLBCL. I learned about objectifying various markers such as size, location, and nodal involvement for staging cancer. As I became more familiar with PET/CT modalities, I was asked to be a part of a second project identifying neck lymph node zones. Both projects aim to decrease the discrepancy of film interpretations among radiologists by utilizing machine-learning techniques to recognize standard patterns in physical anatomy for diagnoses. I am currently working on additional data analysis for refining the manuscript, on which I will be the first author.

#### Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) project
<p class="info">Co-investigator under Dr. Joshua Kra (01/2019 - 12/2020)<br>
Rutgers University NJMS, Newark, NJ</p>
We conducted a retrospective chart review of PIFA results against ELISA for PF4 antibody
and Serotonin Release Assay to assess the utility and accuracy of diagnosing patients with
HIT at an inner-city academic medical center with high patient population with low socio-
economic status. Initial data analysis showed high sensitivity but low specificity for PIFA
testing, consistent with previous studies on PIFA use as a screening test. This project further
suggested the need for future study on the algorithm for diagnosing HIT to improve on
critical and timely diagnosis and management for HIT.

#### Mortality Rates in Breast and Lung Cancer Patients Admitted for Febrile Neutropenia
<p class="info">Researcher under Dr. Jain Maneesh (01/2016 - 05/2017)<br>
Drexel University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA</p>
As part of the monthly Hematology/Oncology interest group meeting and journal club, I participated in a research study that examined mortality rates of various types of cancer patients with febrile neutropenia. My involvement culminated in an abstract submission titled, “Higher Mortality Rates in Breast and Lung Cancer Patients Admitted for Febrile Neutropenia: An Analysis of Outcomes Based on Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2006-2013” for a poster presentation. This poster was presented at Discovery Day 2016, a school-wide presentation with attendings, residents, and other students in attendance.

#### Thymic Epithelial Cells Research
<p class="info">Postbaccalaureate Cancer Researcher under Dr. Richard Hodes (08/2012 - 06/2015)<br>
National Cancer Institute/NIH, Bethesda, MD</p>
I was a post-baccalaureate cancer research training award recipient at NIH in National Cancer Institute/Experimental Immunology Branch. I worked in Dr. Richard Hodes’ lab with seven other researchers studying thymic epithelial cells. I worked both in teams and independently to design a research question, set up mouse models to test the hypothesis, executed the experiments, and wrote manuscripts. The high level of my engagement led to co-authorships in three top-tier journal articles and presentations at the American Association for Immunologist conference in 2014 and 2015. In addition, during Post-bac Poster Day, I was awarded the Post-bac Poster Award for Outstanding Poster Presentation.
